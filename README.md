#Extract & Reverse List Elements
Problem Statement

Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

Extract the first five elements.

Reverse the extracted list.

#Code (using .reverse())
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

print("Original list:", numbers)

# Extract first 5 elements
list1 = numbers[0:5]
print("Extracted first five elements:", list1)

# Reverse in-place using .reverse()
list1.reverse()
print("Reversed extracted elements:", list1)

Sample Run
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
